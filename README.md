# TheRandomBook
A random repo for a random book

This repos is used as a training area to try and learn the magic that we call git. To be honest this is probably the most pointless repo on github, and can never really be used for anything good. Below follows a list of some of the areas where this repo is not useful.

1. Trying to perform heart surgery on a donkey
2. Restarting Windows for the 1000th time because you apperently need to update.
3. Killing a fly
4. Fixing your car because it does not work
5. Saving the Whales
6. Pineapple
7. Trying to cure a really bad hangover
8. Getting drunk (ha good luck)
9. Poking a bear with a stick
